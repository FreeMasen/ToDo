- New system for interaction

- [ ] user 1 sends request to user 2 asking if user 2 wants to participate

- [ ] this message would contain the attack values

- [ ] if user 2 accepts user 1s request, the reply would first perform the defend against
attack method on the uers's thumb, and adds the correct image for the overall interaction.

- [ ]this would require that the the user selects the first message from user 1 and a seperate
view would be needed, or just the text of the single button would need to be updated to indicate the 
status.

- [ ] once I have access to utilize cloud kit, these would need to be tracked on a history table to proivde the
state of the interaction for recall, depending on how long it has been since the interaction started

- [ ] possibly allow an attack back
